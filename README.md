# Reliable Patch Trackers: Robust Visual Tracking by Exploiting Reliable Patches (RPT)
This is the research code of our RPT tracker. It is implemented in matlab code and aimed to academical purpose. Details can be found in our [CVPR paper](https://github.com/ihpdep/ihpdep.github.io/raw/master/papers/cvpr15_rpt.pdf). Please cite our publication if you use the code

# Instructions
* 1) Modify the base_path in "run_tracker.m" with your own setting if needed.
* 2) Run the "run_tracker.m" script in MATLAB.
* 3) Choose sequence.


# Dependencies
Our work employs KCF[1] as the base tracker.
